# Objective 1. Pick your public policy change issue.

Ebola

# Objective 2. Analyze & discuss your issue.

## Related Events Increase/Decrease

This data is "good". Why do we say that? Because we are able to assume the world cared about the ebola outbreak before it reached outside of Africa. We can determine based upon our graphs that there was press coverage around the world before it reached anywhere outside Africa.

## Actors Involved

This second graph further emphasises the fact that the press volume in the US before the outbreak here was still ~equally large. It shows the US cared about Ebola before it was here.

## Georeferencing

Clearly Texas cared alot about the Ebola outbreak in Texas...But besides that, we can see that the US had plenty of press coverage on Ebola before it directly affected us.

## Source URLs

## Conclusions

Interestingly, we found the response to the crisis in America and Africa were actually quite similar.  Though the case in Houston had a 10% increase in events over that of the escalation to Level 3 WHO rating, this was a much smaller difference than we expected.

It would be nice to sort articles on more than just "ebola" in the URL, we could hopefully pursue this in the future.

This was not necessarily a public policy pursuit.  But airports should be aware of cases, and news outlets should report equally on international and local crises.  This is done fairly well according to this (quite minimal) research.
