We would say that this is concerning because only two days after Obama asked for international cooperation, there is a drop in events about appealing for or intending to provide humanitarian aid, but it then increases, so the first graph was inconclusive (neither good nor bad). 

The second graph was more expected because there was a big spike in allowing delivery of humanitarian aid. This is good.

Here we see a slow response from Africa in regards to the Goldstein scale, we don't see a negative trend within the african nations that are directly affected until the 18th when Obama announced the threat on the 16th. This could be a testament to Africa's lack of reliance and or the dependability of media converge within Africa.

## Conclusions

yes, countries whose media coverage, such as areas in Africa, may receive inaccurate Goldstein ratings due to their limited resources and media coverage.
