## Related Events Increase/Decrease

We see an increase in events pertaining to requests for humanitarian aid. This could definitely been seen as a correlation with Obama's address for global intervention with the ebola outbreak. These requests have good intentions and we see that their numbers have increased so we would say that this increasing trend was good.


## Actors Involved

Not suprisingly, Hospitals, physicians, doctors, and nurses are the most common actors. It might be interesting that the US and China are also large actors as well.

We sorted by 'Provide humanitarian aid' and found that after the speech, there was an increase in humanitarian aid provided increased globally, especially in the US and Africa.

## Conclusions

Hypothesis: After the US Announcment pressing world leaders to speed Ebola response, an increase in the providing of humanitarian aid should be observed worldwide.

Our analysis began by observing the trend in the goldstein scale over the course of a week, beginning on September 14th. It's immediately obvious that there is an increase on September 16th, which continues to trend upward.

For further analysis, a heatmap of Actor type code is produced, and it can be observed that events including 'HOSPITAL', 'DOCTOR', 'PHYSICIAN', and 'SOCIAL WORKER' are among those with the most records.

While filtering for event code 73, 'Providing Humanitarian Aid', a worldwide increase is observed from September 15th to September 16th, as shown on the map.

Overall, there was likely a correlation between Obama's speech and humanitarian aid being given, which could be assumed to be aid being provided to West Africa.
