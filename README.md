Increase in related events, so I supppose a good thing? As we have had only 1 death and a huge increase in awareness, the goldstein
scale doesn't give us that much information, at it neither theatens nor bolsters the stability of the USFG. 

## Actors Involved

We are analyzing the increase in United States attention as Ebola moves from a world wide epidemic to one where US citizens are directly involved.
These Actors tell us the events are happening in the United States.

## Georeferencing

## Source URLs

The Goldstein scale was not terribly useful, by filtering by source URL, we are able to get the events that happen in the United States where "Ebola" is part
of the source URL.

## Conclusions

1. The Goldstein ranking score is only for stability analysis of events. For Ebola outbreaks, this probably don't make the USFG more or less stable, giving us only vaguely relevant information. 

2. Other data sets around specific grouping of news "types" (Major publication, minor publications, government report, academic paper, blog, ect.) would be interesting to give us a better view on how Media attention is influenced by domestic vs international problems.



1. We found that the United States Media had many more "hits" post September 30th as opposed to before September 30th

2. We must kill all people with Ebola before we allow the disease to spread; for the greater good. (But seriously, our analysis was more of an examination of the focus of media as opposed to public policy suggestions. CDC appears to be preaching the "Think Ebola" methodology at the moment, this seems reasonable.)
